| --- | --- | --- |
| Clarity | The story is easy to understand and unambiguous? | 12 |
| Completeness | Are acceptance criteria and preconditions well-defined? | 10 |
| Business Value Alignment | Does it reflect tangible healthcare value (e.g., patient safety, compliance, operational efficiency)? | 18 |
| Testability | Can QA engineers easily derive test cases from it? | 15 |
| Technical Feasibility | Is it practically implementable within typical healthcare system constraints? | 16 |

**Overall Quality Score (out of 100)**

84 / 100

**Improvement Recommendations**

1. **Clarity**: Add more context to the story to make it easier to understand. For example, what type of prescriptions are we talking about (e.g., medication, lab results, etc.)?
2. **Completeness**: Specify acceptance criteria for the story, such as:
	* What are the valid and invalid states for the prescription approval workflow?
	* How will errors be handled (e.g., duplicate prescriptions, invalid dosages)?
3. **Business Value Alignment**: While the story has a strong focus on compliance, consider adding more details on how this will improve patient safety or operational efficiency.
4. **Testability**: Provide more information on the system actors involved in the approval workflow (e.g., doctor, pharmacist, patient). This will help QA engineers derive more comprehensive test cases.
5. **Technical Feasibility**: While the story is technically feasible, consider adding more details on the integration with existing EHR systems and any potential technical challenges.

**Example of Improved User Story**

As a doctor, I want to review and approve patient prescriptions digitally before they reach the pharmacy, ensuring safety and compliance, by integrating with our existing EHR system and reducing the risk of medication errors.

**Acceptance Criteria**

* The prescription approval workflow is integrated with the EHR system.
* The system checks for duplicate prescriptions and invalid dosages.
* The doctor can approve or reject prescriptions digitally.
* The pharmacy receives notifications when a prescription is approved or rejected.

**System Actors**

* Doctor: Approves or rejects prescriptions digitally.
* Pharmacist: Receives notifications when a prescription is approved or rejected.
* Patient: Has their prescription information updated in the EHR system.

By addressing these areas, the user story will be more comprehensive, testable, and aligned with the business value of improving patient safety and operational efficiency in the healthcare system.
